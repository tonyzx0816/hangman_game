This Python program recreates the classic word-guessing game, Hangman.

How to Play:

1. Run the program: Execute the Python script.

2. Guess letters: The game will present a series of underscores representing the hidden word. Enter a single letter as your guess.

3. Feedback:
If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct positions;
If the letter is not in the word, you lose a life.

4. Continue guessing: Keep guessing letters until you either:
Win: Guess all the letters in the word before running out of lives.
Lose: Exhaust all your lives without guessing the word.
